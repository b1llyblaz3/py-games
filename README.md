# Dynamic Physics Simulations

This project provides a lightweight foundation for experimenting with
2D and 3D physics simulation code. The repository is intentionally
minimal so new modules can be added as needed.

## Setup
1. Create and activate a Python virtual environment (optional).
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the placeholder demos:
   ```bash
   python src/physics2d.py
   python src/physics3d.py
   ```

The placeholder modules simply print a message and can be extended with
actual simulation logic.
